# Why did i create this script? (rant)

Someone asked me why, here is my reason.

One day in November 2022 when I logged on my steam account, I was greated with a message that I was banned in PUBG permanent, I was very supprised, but I was sure it must have been a mistake since I don't support cheating in any online games.

I thought, this could be easy fixed by contacting their support...... I was wrong though. After countless talks back and forth with different support people, and departments. Their answer was the same robotic response, that I broke their rules of conduct, and they 
could not tell me why I was banned. 

I read the rules many times, and could not find any reason why exactly I was banned, maybe I was running some weird software they didn't allow, or maybe it was unicorn dancing around in my windows installation, who knows.

But the fact of the matter is, I don't like people or companies telling me what I can use my PC for, what is it their business to scan if I have specific software installed as long as it doesn't touch the process memory.

I think they have gone to far with all these kernel anti cheat systems, and that is the reason I like cleaning up sometimes, and the fact that PUBG use 3 different ones at the same time, that is just absurd.

And another reason is, some of these kernel anti cheat system have actually caused problems in the past for many people with crashes because of incompatibily problems with other drivers.

So this is my story, I was marked with a permanent game ban on my 20 year old steam account with over 500 games on it, that made me angry, and I lost interrest in supporting platforms like Steam or Epic, I think the good old days with DVD's and Patches was the way to go.

Anyway hope this script will help some people.

# Software that I've heard rumours about giving a ban:

Razer Synapse 2 or 3 (Had this installed when I was banned)

RTSS Rivatuner Statistics Server (Had this installed when I was banned)

VMware Software (Had this installed when I was banned)

Intelligent standby list cleaner (ISLC) (used for modifying timer resolution in windows, supposed to improve performance)

Editing configuration files for games (PUBG have rules against modifying configuration files manually)
